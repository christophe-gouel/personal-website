Welcome to my home page.

I am working as an academic economist at INRAE in the [Paris-Saclay Applied Economis research unit](https://psae-saclay.fr/en/), where I am a senior research fellow.

My main research topic is the dynamics of agricultural markets.

My work deals with two separate issues: the short-run and the long-run dynamics of agricultural markets. Regarding short-run issues, I study the causes of commodity prices volatility and the design of stabilization policies. On long-run issues, I work on global food security and international trade in agricultural goods.

## Short vitae

- Since 2019, I am a senior research fellow at INRAE.
- In 2012/2018, I was a research fellow at INRA.
- In 2017/2018, I was a visiting fellow at [IFPRI, in the division Market, Trade an Institutions](https://www.ifpri.org/division/markets-trade-and-institutions-mtid).
- In 2011/2012, I was an economist at the World Bank, Development research group for the Agriculture and Rural Development program.
- In 2008/2011, I was an economist in INRA, Economie Publique research unit. I was also a PhD student at the Econometrics Laboratory at the Ecole Polytechnique. [My PhD dissertation](https://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/pastel-00584922/) revolves around agricultural prices fluctuations and of the optimal design of stabilisation policies. I defended it in April 2011 and I was under the direction of [Jean-Marc Bourgeon](https://sites.google.com/site/jeanmarcbourgeoneconomics/) and [SÃ©bastien Jean](http://sebastien.jean.eco.free.fr/).
- In 2006/2008, I was an economist at [CEPII](https://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/welcome.asp), where I am still a scientific advisor. At CEPII, I contributed to the development of the applied general equilibrium model [MIRAGE](https://mirage-model.eu) and I used it to study issues such as agricultural policies, trade policies and WTO negotiations.
