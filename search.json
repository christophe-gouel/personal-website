    "title": "How International Trade Shaped France’s Carbon Footprint",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Globalization has progressively separated where goods are consumed from where greenhouse gases are emitted during production. At the national level, emissions are traditionally measured where they are produced (the “national inventory” approach). Alternatively, emissions can be measured where goods and services are consumed: the “carbon footprint” approach. The carbon footprint attributes emissions to a country’s demand, including emissions embedded in imports and excluding those embedded in exports. If a country’s carbon footprint exceeds its national inventory, more greenhouse gases are embedded in its imports than in its exports.\nThe rise of international trade in recent decades has led to a growing divergence between national inventories and countries’ carbon footprints. This gap is particularly pronounced for France: between 2000 and 2014,1 its territorial emissions decreased by 18%, while its carbon footprint dropped by only 5%. In 2014, emissions within the national territory amounted to 452 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent (Mt CO₂e), whereas France’s carbon footprint stood at 680 Mt CO₂e. The difference between these two indicators, 228 Mt CO₂e, represents the country’s net imports of greenhouse gases: France exports 136 Mt CO₂e through its sales of goods and services abroad and imports 364 Mt CO₂e.\nA country’s carbon footprint can be divided into two components: emissions from domestic consumption (goods and services produced and consumed within its borders) and imported emissions, embedded in goods and services originating from other countries.2 In 2014, imported emissions accounted for 54% of France’s total carbon footprint (364 out of 680 Mt CO₂e). This is a notably high share compared to other countries with similar levels of development. Between 2000 and 2008, France saw a sharp rise in the proportion of imported emissions in its carbon footprint, which increased from 45% to 54% (Figure 1). From 2008 to 2014, this share remained relatively stable, with just over half of France’s carbon footprint linked to foreign production. This figure is more than double the global and U.S. averages, which hover around 25%. The share of imported emissions is also higher in France than the average in the European Union, although France and the EU have followed similar overall trends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The share of imported emissions in France’s carbon footprint is particularly high.\nSubtitle: Greenhouse gas imports as a percentage of the carbon footprint.\nNotes: The carbon footprint includes the majority of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide). The value for the EU-28 corresponds to the ratio between total imported emissions and the total footprint of the 27 EU member states plus the United Kingdom. Each country’s imports include intra-European trade flows.\nSource: Authors’ calculations, see Cotterlaz and Gouel (2026).\n\n\n\nWhere are the greenhouse gases generated by French demand emitted? Primarily in other European countries, though emissions linked to imports from China have grown significantly in recent years (Table 1). About 15% of France’s carbon footprint originates from goods and services produced in other EU member states, a share that remained steady from 2000 to 2014. In contrast, emissions associated with imports from China rose sharply, tripling between 2000 and 2008, from 19 to 62 Mt CO₂e, before stabilizing at 49 Mt CO₂e in 2014. While Chinese imports accounted for less than 3% of France’s carbon footprint in 2000, they represented 7% of this footprint by 2014. Emissions from the rest of the world became more prominent: their share of France’s carbon footprint rose from 26% to 32% between 2000 and 2014.\n\n\n\nTable 1\n\n\nFrench greenhouse gas emissions are increasingly imported, particularly from China.\nSubtitle: Contribution by country to France’s carbon footprint.\nSource: Author’s calculations from WIOD 2016, Eurostat, and EXIOBASE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare of French carbon footprint emitted in:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\nFrance\n\n\nUE28\n\n\nChina\n\n\nOther countries\n\n\nTotal footprint (Mt CO₂e)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2000\n\n\n55\n\n\n16\n\n\n3\n\n\n26\n\n\n707\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\n46\n\n\n14\n\n\n8\n\n\n32\n\n\n805\n\n\n\n\n2014\n\n\n46\n\n\n15\n\n\n7\n\n\n32\n\n\n680"

(2025)\n[Slides]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper revisits the existence of a carbon bias in trade policies, where emissions-intensive sectors receive lower trade protection than cleaner sectors. Using a stylized general equilibrium model that accounts for greenhouse gas emissions, we confirm the presence of a carbon bias but find it to be significantly smaller than previously estimated. Our analysis reveals that this bias is primarily driven by low tariffs on fossil fuels, particularly crude oil. Incorporating the finite nature of fossil fuel resources into the model reduces the responsiveness of fossil fuel production to tariff changes, effectively neutralizing the carbon bias. Furthermore, when accounting for domestic consumption taxes on fossil fuels in non-producing countries—which act as de facto tariffs—the bias shifts toward a pro-environmental stance. These findings underscore the importance of integrating energy markets’ specificities and domestic distortions into trade models to better account for the impact of trade policies on the environment."

[Programs, Brief (en, fr), Slides]\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study examines the evolution of France’s carbon footprint from 2000 to 2014, with a particular focus on the role of international trade. During this period, France’s territorial emissions decreased by 18%, yet its consumption-based footprint declined by only 5%. This modest reduction reflects an increase in emissions embedded in imports, which grew from 45% to 54% of the total. Employing a novel structural decomposition analysis, we disentangle the contributions of scale, composition, and technique effects from a consumption perspective. Our approach advances traditional methods by explicitly distinguishing between domestic and foreign influences and by separately analyzing trade openness and the geographic reallocation of trade flows. The results underscore the dominance of the technique effect in reducing emissions (-28%), driven primarily by efficiency improvements abroad. However, the geographic composition effect led to a substantial increase in emissions (+18%), especially due to shifts toward more carbon-intensive trading partners prior to 2008. This pattern—characterized by a growing reliance on foreign improvements for emission reductions—likely foreshadows developments in other developed economies as domestic decarbonization advances. It highlights the need for greater coordination between trade and climate policies.\n\nThe Role of Storage in Commodity Markets: Indirect Inference Based on Grains Data \nGouel C. and Legrand N. (2025)\nQuantitative Economics, 16(2), 705–747. [Appendix, Programs, Brief, Slides]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nWe develop an indirect inference approach relying on a linear supply and demand model serving as an auxiliary model to provide the first full empirical test of the rational expectations commodity storage model. We build a rich storage model that incorporates a supply response and four structural shocks and show that exploiting information on both prices and quantities is critical for relaxing previous restrictive identifying assumptions and assessing the empirical consistency of the model’s features. Finally, we carry out a structural estimation on the aggregate index of the world’s most important staple food products. Our estimations show that supply shocks are the main drivers of food market dynamics and that our storage model is consistent with most of the moments in the data, including the high price persistence so far the subject of a long‐standing puzzle.\n\nMeasuring Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture: An Equilibrium Perspective on Supply-Side Approaches\nGouel C. (2025)\nJournal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists, 12(1), 181–220. [Appendix, Slides, Programs, Blog post, Pre-print]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nClimate change impacts on agriculture are mostly estimated by supply-side reduced-form regressions, under the implicit assumption of constant crop prices. To test whether this assumption is innocuous, I use a quantitative trade model of global agricultural markets to emulate the findings of a supply-side approach and to calculate welfare changes accounting for price changes. The results show that both welfare measures are weakly correlated and can be of opposite signs and that the supply-side approach tends to underestimate the cost of climate change because of the imperfect substitutability of crops in demand.\n\nInterest Rate Dynamics and Commodity Prices\nGouel C., Ma Q., and Stachurski J. (2024)\nJournal of Economic Theory, 222, 105915. [Programs, Pre-print]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nIn economic studies and popular media, interest rates are routinely cited as a major factor behind commodity price fluctuations. At the same time, the transmission channels are far from transparent, leading to long-running debates on the sign and magnitude of interest rate effects. Purely empirical studies struggle to address these issues because of the complex interactions between interest rates, prices, supply changes, and aggregate demand. To move this debate to a solid footing, we extend the competitive storage model to include stochastically evolving interest rates. We establish general conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions and provide a systematic theoretical and quantitative analysis of the interactions between interest rates and prices.\n\nLove of Variety and Gains from Trade\nGouel C. and Jean S. (2023)\nEuropean Economic Review, 158, 104558. [Appendix, Programs, Post-print]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nWe show analytically and quantitatively how gains from trade depend on love of variety, defined as the extent to which an additional product variety generates benefits in either final or intermediate consumption. To do this, we use a multi-country, multi-sector heterogeneous-firm gravity trade model where love of variety is parameterized separately from product substitutability using a generalized CES demand function. Counterfactual simulations based on a calibrated version of this model show that the gains from trade commonly vary by a proportion of one to three depending on the value of the love-of-variety elasticity. Trade war simulations also point to the strong sensitivity of the assessed impacts. We conclude that love of variety may be an important determinant of the gains from trade, an aspect that has so far been overlooked for the sake of convenience in the modeling framework and due to lack of empirical estimates.\n\nThe Crucial Role of Domestic and International Market-Mediated Adaptation to Climate Change \nGouel C. and Laborde D. (2021)\nJournal of Environmental Economics and Management, 106, 102408. [Appendix, Programs, Brief]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nClimate change effects on agricultural yields will be uneven over the world. A few countries, mostly in high latitudes, may experience gains, while most will see average yield decrease. This paper aims to quantify the role of market-mediated adjustments in attenuating the effects of climate change by allowing the expression of the new climate-induced pattern of comparative advantages within and between countries. To do this, we develop a quantitative general equilibrium trade model where the representation of land use choice is inspired from modern Ricardian trade models. We use spatially explicit information from the agronomic literature about potential yields before and after climate change for calibration and counterfactual simulations. The results show that the climate-induced yield changes generate large price movements that incentivize adjustments in production and trade. Both production and trade adjustments contribute to reducing welfare losses globally, with production adjustments making the larger contribution.\n\nThe Value of Public Information in Storable Commodity Markets: Application to the Soybean Market\nGouel C. (2020)\nAmerican Journal of Agricultural Economics, 102(3), 846–865. [Appendix, Programs, Post-print]\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThis article provides a framework to estimate the potential effects and benefits of the provision of market information in storable commodity markets. This framework is applied to the case of production forecasts for the soybean market. A rational expectations storage model of the global soybean market accounting for both inter-annual and intra-annual market dynamics is built. Shocks that occur between planting and harvesting affect the size of the potential harvest. Estimates of the size of these shocks are reported publicly and affect the market equilibrium through adjustments to stock levels. By varying counterfactually the observability of seasonal shocks, we can estimate the efficiency gains related to the availability of advance information. They are equivalent to 2% of storage costs; the reduction of stock levels being the main channel explaining the welfare gains. The presence of advance information has a limited effect on inter-annual price volatility but redistributes price volatility during the season, increasing it just before harvest when almost all news has been received and stocks are tight and decreasing it after harvest. The effect of news shocks is stronger on higher order moments of the distribution with a strong decrease in skewness and kurtosis related to the lower frequency of price spikes.\n\n\n\nAward\n\nWinner of the European Association of Agricultural Economists’ 2020 Research Discovery Award.\n\nNutrition Transition and the Structure of Global Food Demand\nGouel C. and Guimbard H. (2019)\nAmerican Journal of Agricultural Economics, 101(2), 383–403. [Appendix, Programs, MAIDADS Simulator (Excel spreadsheet), Post-print, Brief (fr)]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nEstimating future demand for food is a critical aspect of global food security analyses. The process linking dietary changes to wealth is known as the nutrition transition and presents well-identified features that help to predict consumption changes in poor countries. This study proposes to represent the nutrition transition with a nonhomothetic, flexible-in-income demand system. The resulting model is estimated statistically based on cross-sectional information from FAOSTAT. The model captures the main features of the nutrition transition: rise in demand for calories associated with income growth; diversification of diets away from starchy staples; and a large increase in caloric demand for animal-based products, fats, and sweeteners. The estimated model is used to project food demand between 2010 and 2050 based on a set of plausible futures (trend projections and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways scenarios). The main results of these projections are: (a) global food demand will increase by 47%, less than half the growth in the previous four decades; (b) this growth will be attributable mainly to lower-middle-income and low-income countries; (c) the structure of global food demand will change over the period, with a doubling of demand for animal-based calories and a much smaller 19% increase in demand for starchy staples; and (d) the analysis of a range of population and income projections reveals important uncertainties—depending on the scenario, the projected increases in demand for animal-based and vegetal-based calories range from 74% to 114%, and from 20% to 42%, respectively.\n\nEstimating the Competitive Storage Model with Trending Commodity Prices\nGouel C. and Legrand N. (2017)\nJournal of Applied Econometrics, 32(4), 744–763. [Appendix, Programs, Post-print]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nWe present a method to estimate jointly the parameters of a standard commodity storage model and the parameters characterizing the trend in commodity prices. This procedure allows the influence of a possible trend to be removed without restricting the model specification, and allows model and trend selection based on statistical criteria. The trend is modeled deterministically using linear or cubic spline functions of time. The results show that storage models with trend are always preferred to models without trend. They yield more plausible estimates of the structural parameters, with storage costs and demand elasticities that are more consistent with the literature. They imply occasional stockouts, whereas without trend the estimated models predict no stockouts over the sample period for most commodities. Moreover, accounting for a trend in the estimation implies price moments closer to those observed in commodity prices. Our results support the empirical relevance of the speculative storage model, and show that storage model estimations should not neglect the possibility of long-run price trends.\n\nTrade Policy Coordination and Food Price Volatility\nGouel C. (2016)\nAmerican Journal of Agricultural Economics, 98(4), 1018–1037. [Appendix, Programs, Post-print]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nMany countries adjust their trade policies counter-cyclically with food prices, to the extent that the use of restrictions by food-exporting countries has occasionally threatened the food security of food-importing countries. These trade policies are inconsistent with the terms-of-trade motivation often retained to characterize the payoff frontier of self-enforcing trade agreements, as they can worsen the terms of trade of the countries that apply them. This article analyzes trade policy coordination when trade policies are driven by terms-of-trade effects and a desire to reduce domestic food price volatility. This framework implies that importing and exporting countries have incentives to deviate from cooperation at different periods: the latter when prices are high and the former when prices are low. Since staple food prices tend to have asymmetric distributions, with more prices below than above the mean but with occasional spikes, a self-enforcing agreement generates asymmetric outcomes. Without cooperation, an importing country uses its trade policy more frequently because of the concentration of prices below the mean, but an exporting country has a greater incentive to deviate from a cooperative trade policy because positive deviations from the mean price are larger than negative ones. Thus, the asymmetry of the distribution of commodity prices can make it more difficult to discipline export taxes than tariffs in trade agreements.\n\nManaging Food Price Volatility in a Large Open Country: The Case of Wheat in India\nGouel C., Gautam M. and Martin W. J. (2016)\nOxford Economic Papers, 68(3), 811–835. [Appendix, Programs, Post-print]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nIndia has pursued an active food security policy for many years by using a combination of trade policy interventions, public distribution of food staples, and assistance to farmers through minimum support prices defended by public stocks. This approach has been quite successful in stabilizing staple food prices, but comes at a high cost, and with potential risks of unmanageable stock accumulation. Based on a rational expectations storage model representing the Indian wheat market and its relation to the rest of the world, we analyse the cost and welfare implications of this policy, and unpack the contribution of its various elements. To analyse alternative policies, we assume that social welfare includes an objective of price stabilization and assess optimal policies corresponding to this objective. We consider fully optimal policies under commitment as well as optimal simple rules, and show that adopting simple rules can achieve most of the gains from fully optimal policies.\n\nOptimal Food Price Stabilization in a Small Open Developing Country\nGouel C. and Jean S. (2015)\nWorld Bank Economic Review, 29(1), 72–101. [Appendix, Programs, Post-print]\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper analyzes the use of storage and trade policies to achieve food price stabilization in a small open developing country. Optimal stabilization policies are identified using a rational expectations storage model with risk-averse consumers and incomplete markets. Without public intervention, price dynamics are driven by domestic productive shocks and international prices. On its own, an optimal storage policy is found to be detrimental to consumers because its stabilizing benefits leak to the world market. In contrast, an optimal combination of storage and trade policies results in a powerful stabilization of domestic food prices. However, such an optimal combination is shown to entail two serious drawbacks: its distributive impacts are large compared to its efficiency benefits, and by distorting excess supply curves, it may aggravate high world price episodes.\n\n\n\nAward\n\nWinner of the European Association of Agricultural Economists’ Quality of Policy Contribution Award in honor of Giovanni Anania.\n\nFood Security and Storage in the Middle East and North Africa\nLarson D. F., Lampietti J., Gouel C., Cafiero C. and Roberts J. (2014)\nWorld Bank Economic Review, 28(1), 48–73. [Programs, Post-print]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nIn times of highly volatile commodity markets, governments often try to protect their populations from rapidly rising food prices, which can be particularly harmful for the poor. A potential solution for food-deficit countries is to hold strategic reserves that can be called on when international prices spike. But how large should strategic stockpiles be, and what rules should govern their release? In this paper, we develop a dynamic competitive storage model for wheat in the Middle East and North Africa region, where imported wheat is the most significant component of the average diet. We analyze a strategy that sets aside wheat stockpiles, which can be used to keep domestic prices below a targeted price. Our analysis shows that if the target price is set high and reserves are adequate, the strategy can be effective and robust. Contrary to most interventions, strategic storage policies are counter-cyclical, and when the importing region is sufficiently large, a regional policy can smooth global prices. Simulations indicate that this is the case for the Middle East and North Africa region. Nevertheless, the policy is more costly than a procyclical policy similar to food stamps that uses targeted transfers to directly offset high prices with a subsidy.\n\nRules versus Discretion in Food Storage Policies\nGouel C. (2013)\nAmerican Journal of Agricultural Economics, 95(4), 1029–1044. [Appendix, Programs, Post-print]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThis article compares various policies in a rational expectations food storage model with risk-averse consumers and missing insurance markets calibrated to represent a developing country. I consider an optimal storage policy under discretion and two optimal simple rules: a constant private storage subsidy and a price band. The storage subsidy achieves welfare gains similar to the discretionary policy. The price band maximizing social welfare is a price-peg scheme: The floor and ceiling prices are the same, and the capacity constraint represents 11% of the steady-state production level. This price band achieves three-quarters of the gains from the optimal policy under discretion.\n\nComparing Numerical Methods for Solving the Competitive Storage Model\nGouel C. (2013)\nComputational Economics, 41(2), 267–295. [Programs, Post-print]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper compares numerical methods for solving the competitive storage model. Because storage implies a nonnegativity constraint on stocks, the solution methods must be considered carefully. The model is solved using value function iteration and several projection approaches, including parameterised expectations and decision rules approximation. In considering a storage model with convenience yield, in which the inequality constraint is smoothed, perturbation methods are also applied. Parameterised expectations approximation proves to be the most accurate method, whereas perturbation techniques are shown inadequate for solving this highly nonlinear model. The endogenous grid method allows rapid solution if supply is assumed to be inelastic.\n\nOptimal Food Price Stabilisation Policy\nGouel C. (2013)\nEuropean Economic Review, 57, 118–134. [Appendix, Programs, Post-print]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper proposes a framework for designing optimal food price stabilisation policies in a self-sufficient developing country. It uses a rational expectations storage model with risk-averse consumers and incomplete markets. Government stabilises food prices by carrying public stock and by applying a state-contingent subsidy/tax to production. The policy rules are designed to maximise intertemporal welfare. The optimal policy under commitment crowds out all private stockholding activity by removing the profit opportunity from speculation. The countercyclical subsidy/tax to production helps price stabilisation by subsidising production in periods of scarcity and by taxing it in periods of glut. It contributes little to welfare gains, most of which come from stabilisation achieved through public storage.\n\nAgricultural Price Instability: A Survey of Competing Explanations and Remedies\nGouel C. (2012)\nJournal of Economic Surveys, 26(1), 129–156. [Post-print]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThere are two explanations for agricultural price dynamics. One follows cobweb logic and models fluctuations driven by expectation errors but emphasises that these expectations create complex dynamics and possibly chaos. The other stems from the rational expectations tradition of dynamics driven by real shocks. The empirical evidence tends to support the latter, but is not conclusive. The rational expectations model generates an optimal dynamic path from which no improvement can be expected from public intervention. However, if we take account of all the potential market failures in agricultural markets, and especially in developing countries, this conclusion might require some qualifications, although an appropriate policy design for stability has still to be achieved. This paper surveys the positive and normative literature on agricultural prices, highlighting empirical evidence and identifying remaining unresolved issues.\n\nSensitive Products in the Doha Negotiations: The Case of European and Japanese Market Access\nGouel C., Mitaritona C. and Ramos M.P. (2011)\nEconomic Modelling, 28(6), 2395–2403. [Pre-print]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nGiven the highly concentrated distribution of agricultural protection, allowing in the negotiations too many exceptions through sensitive products puts at risk the objectives of World Trade Organization. This issue is difficult to analyze with the commonly used applied trade models, because they represent trade flows at an aggregate level, while sensitive products are picked at the product level and their protection, under the form of tariff-rate quotas, is contingent on the level of imports. This paper assesses the effect of these exceptions, based on the case of agricultural trade protection in Europe and Japan, two countries where tariff dismantling in the agricultural sector is a particularly sensitive issue. Since agricultural border protection is heterogeneous, we avoid aggregation bias by extending a multi-country computable general equilibrium model to the product level. This allows us to represent trade policies explicitly and to account for their interdependencies. The results suggest that consideration of sensitive products strongly limits the potential gains from a possible agriculture agreement at Doha. Moreover, there is no aggregate trade-off between decreasing tariffs and increasing/opening quotas. To achieve “substantial” market access improvements in the agricultural sector, the objective should be most favored nation tariff reduction."

    "title": "Markets Are Adaptation, Too: Rethinking Who Gains and Who Loses from Climate Change in Agriculture",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The familiar story runs like this: climate change lowers yields, farmers lose, so countries with worse weather get poorer. That chain of reasoning feels natural because it follows the production side of agriculture—the agronomy—and a narrow view of “adaptation” to climate change centered on technology (new varieties, altered planting dates, irrigation upgrades, better pest management). It misses a second form of adaptation that is less visible because it works in the background of the global food system: markets. Because climate shocks are uneven across crops and places, relative prices change—and those price signals drive three margins of adjustment: consumer switching among products, trade reallocation, and land reallocation.\nThose market responses are not an afterthought; they are built in. And they mean the effects we care about—on producers, consumers, and national welfare—need not track local yields one for one. A country with modest agronomic outcomes might lose more if it is a net importer of a staple whose world price jumps. Another, even with mixed yield outcomes, might gain if it is a major exporter whose selling price improves. Market-mediated adaptation is coordinated by price movements and works along three margins:\n\nConsumer switching among products. When relative prices change, households substitute toward cheaper foods and away from dearer ones, within dietary and processing limits. Because staples are imperfect substitutes, the food price index often rises when multiple staples are hit.\nTrade reallocation. Countries import more of what they find more difficult to grow and export what becomes relatively competitive. This reshuffling changes a country’s terms of trade—the rate at which it exchanges exports for imports.\nLand reallocation. Within each country, cropland shifts toward crops with better relative returns. Climate-driven yield changes can induce reallocation even at constant prices, but price movements alter the direction and scale of these shifts.\n\nThese mechanisms work even without any new technology. Leaving them out of impact measurement is not a benign simplification—it biases our view of who is hurt and by how much. We now clarify the mechanisms through which markets mediate the effect of climate change.\n\n\nTo clarify the role of markets in adaptation, consider a closed country growing only one crop. This example is illustrated by Figure 1. Climate change can be represented as a pivotal shift of the supply curve to the left, reducing supply for all prices. In this closed, one‑good economy, a leftward pivot of the supply curve raises the domestic price and reduces the quantity demanded. The new equilibrium sits above and to the left of the original: less is produced and consumed, and the price is higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Market-mediated adaptations are modest in a one-good, one-country setting.\nSubtitle: Welfare changes from climate change in a one-good, closed-economy.\nNotes: Initial equilibrium (\\(Q, P\\)) and equilibrium after climate change (\\(Q', P'\\)). Climate change is represented as a pivotal shift to the left of the supply curve reducing production at constant price to \\(\\delta Q\\). The orange area corresponds to the welfare change assuming constant price, and the purple area corresponds to the additional welfare change when the price is allowed to adjust.\nSource: Adapted from Gouel (2025, fig. 1)\n\n\n\nBecause demand and supply meet in a single market for one good, the extra welfare effect of letting the price adjust is small—the tiny triangle between the fixed‑price counterfactual and the new market equilibrium. In this simplified setting, a fixed‑price “supply‑side” calculation gives a reasonable approximation to the total welfare change. But focusing only on the country’s aggregate welfare can hide who bears the loss. The higher price transfers surplus from consumers to producers. Staple foods typically have very low demand elasticity, so even small production declines can trigger large price increases—as seen during the recent global food price spike associated with the war in Ukraine. In such situations, consumers tend to be the ultimate losers, while producers can be more than compensated for lower output by the higher price.\n\n\n\nIn an open economy with two countries—Home and Foreign—trading one agricultural good, the same negative climate shock pivots both supply curves to the left. World demand and trade arbitrage pin down a single price. As that world price rises, Home (the initial net exporter) ships less but at a higher price, while Foreign (the initial net importer) purchases less and pays more. Figure 2 depicts the welfare accounting: the orange areas measure the fixed‑price (supply‑side) evaluation at the benchmark price; the purple areas capture the additional change once the price is allowed to adjust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Market-mediated adaptations can become large in open economy.\nSubtitle: Welfare changes from climate change in a one-good, two-country economy.\nNotes: Initial equilibrium (\\(C_h, C_f, Q_h, Q_f, P\\)) and equilibrium after climate change (\\(C_h', C_f', Q_h', Q_f', P'\\)). Climate change is represented as a pivotal shift to the left of the supply curves by \\(\\delta\\). The orange areas correspond to the welfare changes assuming constant price, and the purple areas correspond to the additional welfare changes when the price is allowed to adjust.\nSource: Adapted from Gouel (2025, fig. 2)\n\n\n\nFor the exporter (Home), the fixed‑price approach overstates the welfare loss because it ignores the improvement in the terms of trade: part of the domestic loss is offset by selling fewer units at a higher price. For the importer (Foreign), the fixed‑price approach understates the loss: beyond the domestic effect of the supply shift, the country pays more for every imported unit, so the welfare loss is aggravated compared with a fixed-price setting. In this two‑country setting the importer’s welfare change associated with market mediation is larger in absolute value than the exporter’s, and the two terms have opposite signs. Aggregating across countries cancels these price-change transfers (i.e., terms-of-trade transfers), so the world‑level market-mediated welfare change is the same small purple one found in the single‑country (autarky) case (Figure 1).\nHow large the country‑level terms-of-trade effect becomes depends on the size of the climate shock, how uneven it is across countries, each country’s trade share, and demand and supply elasticities. For an exporting country, suffering a yield shock relatively smaller than the global shock, the terms‑of‑trade component dominates and market‑mediated adaptation becomes the main driver of the difference between fixed‑price and full‑equilibrium welfare.\n\n\n\nThe other important margin of market-mediated adjustment is that foods are imperfect substitutes in consumption. To clarify what this means, imagine households buy two staples: grains and oils. Climate change hurts grains but helps oils. Even if the average agronomic effect across the two crops looks mild, these products play different roles in diets, and people can’t replace bread with cooking oil one-for-one.\nWhen the grain becomes scarcer, its price rises more than the oil price falls. Households may shift just a bit toward oil, but not much. The cost of a typical grocery basket goes up. A fixed-price tally would treat the grain loss and the oil gain as offsetting—possibly even neutral. Once prices adjust, the cost of eating rises because the newly expensive item is hard to substitute away from. That’s why a market-aware measure can show a loss even when one crop improved."

    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\nAt the world level, letting prices adjust produces a welfare loss of about 0.43 percent of world GDP, whereas the fixed-price calculation shows a small gain of about 0.08 percent (Gouel 2025, Tab. 4). The sign difference comes from the fact that when several staples become relatively scarcer, households cannot fully substitute across foods, implying that the food basket becomes more expensive. At the aggregate level, ignoring limited substitution can make it seem that gains on some crops offset losses on others.\nAt the country level, the ranking changes even more between the approaches. Nineteen out of fifty countries switch sign between the fixed-price and market-equilibrium measures, and in thirty-eight the market-aware welfare is lower than the fixed-price number (see Figure 3). Because foods are imperfect substitutes, welfare changes under the fixed-price approach are often substantially smaller than under market equilibrium—and can even have the wrong sign. Because of the role of terms of trade, a useful rule of thumb to understand a country’s situation is trade position: net importers tend to fare worse once prices move, while some major exporters look better because their selling prices improve. None of this implies that all households share a gain or loss. Producer gains can coexist with consumer losses, and the split between rural and urban households matters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Welfare changes differ markedly between supply-side and market-equilibrium approaches.\nSubtitle: Welfare effects of climate change on agriculture under the two approaches.\nNotes: The points in pink in the top-left and bottom-right quadrants correspond to countries whose welfare measures have opposite signs, the triangle is world welfare, and the blue line is the regression line.\nSource: Adapted from Gouel (2025, fig. 4)\n\n\n\nThese patterns are not artifacts of a single calibration. When substitution possibilities are made unrealistically high and trade frictions very small, the two measures of welfare change converge, for the reasons above. In plausible ranges of parameters, though, the gap persists because of imperfect substitution and terms of trade.\nOther sensitivity exercises that raise substitution elasticities, assume tighter market integration, or add an intensive margin (more output per hectare as prices rise) change magnitudes but not the basic lesson: price movements and trade patterns are central to welfare, and ignoring them can reverse the direction of the effect."

    "text": "Markets Are Adaptation, Too: Rethinking Who Gains and Who Loses from Climate Change in Agriculture\n\n\nThis post is a reproduction of PREFALIM Policy Brief 1.\nMost of us picture climate change hurting farmers because it hurts yields. We also picture “adaptation” as technology—new varieties, different planting dates, smarter irrigation. This post adds a missing piece: markets are adaptation, too. Because climate shocks are uneven across crops and places, prices move, trade reroutes, and land is reallocated—and once those adjustments occur, winners and losers can look very different from the picture you get from a supply-side perspective, in which prices are kept fixed. Two simple ideas drive the difference. First, foods are not freely interchangeable in people’s diets, so the cost of a typical food basket can rise even if some crops do better under climate change. Second, countries that rely on food imports are exposed when world prices rise, while some large exporters may benefit from higher selling prices despite lower yields. Using a global model, letting prices adjust produces an overall economic loss equivalent to 0.43% of world GDP, whereas the fixed‑price calculation—applied to the same climate shocks—shows a small gain of 0.08%. At the country level, 19 of 50 countries switch sign between the two views, and in 38 of 50 the market‑aware measure is lower than the fixed‑price number. The lesson is straightforward: prices reorganize the impacts of climate change. If you ignore them, you risk getting both the size and the direction wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n2025-12-12\n\n\nChristophe Gouel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow International Trade Shaped France’s Carbon Footprint\n\n\nThis post is a reproduction of the English version of the Lettre du CEPII 457.\nFrance stands out for the significant role that imports play in the dynamics of its carbon footprint. Between 2000 and 2014, trade openness worsened France’s carbon footprint, in particular because of the rapid growth of Chinese imports until 2008. At the same time, technological progress within France, but especially abroad, led to a modest reduction in the carbon footprint. For a relatively low-emitting country like France, changes occurring outside the national borders play a key role in the evolution of the carbon footprint. This observation highlights the need to coordinate national efforts with international strategies to reduce emissions linked to the production of our trade partners.\n\n\n\n\n\n2025-11-19\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
